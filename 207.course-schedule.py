# Testcase Example:  '2\n[[1,0]]'
#
# There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
# 
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
# first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
# 
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
# possible for you to finish all courses?
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
# Output: true
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you
# should
# also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
# adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
# You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        visit = [0 for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for x, y in prerequisites:
            graph[x].append(y)
        
        def dfs(i):
            if visit[i] == -1:
                return False
            if visit[i] == 1:
                return True
            visit[i] = -1
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not dfs(j):
                    return False
            visit[i] = 1
            return True
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True
