# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
# You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
# this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# Example: 
# 
# 
# You may serialize the following tree:
# 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   3
# ⁠    / \
# ⁠   4   5
# 
# as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
# 
# 
# Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a
# binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be
# creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
# 
# Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your
# serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
