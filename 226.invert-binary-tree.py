# Invert a binary tree.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# 
# 
# ⁠    4
# ⁠  /   \
# ⁠ 2     7
# ⁠/ \   / \

# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
# 
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you
# can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if root:
            root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)
            return root
